    <h1>Setup the development enviroment</h1>
    <p><strong>Creating native apps is NOT recommented! Create OSSL apps! If it still doesn't work using OSSL, comment
            in the official OSSL project here! Native apps are helpful if you need to access features that are not
            implemented yet or require specific things that may be unsecure(When modding OnakOS it may be
            helpful)</strong></p>
    <p>To setup the development enviroment you firstly need to create a copy of OnakOS or you need to remix it</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When copying you are not allowed to publish it however you can publish the app itself without the OS!
            Remixing and then publishing makes it for users easier to test your app without importing it somewhere</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Now we finally can begin! Click <code>Click Inside</code> on the project page.
        You need to look for a sprite called <code>apps//template</code>.
        In that sprite there are all scripts that are required for an App.</p>
    <p>You need to replace &quot;example&quot; with you app name(It should be like this
        <code>Authorname.Appname</code>)<img src="https://cloud.majic.rs/index.php/s/Q2FCjRTEDLkwtDD/download"
            alt="Stack" /></p>
    <p>The second required change is to replace in the broadcast &quot;example&quot; with your app
        name<code>Authorname.Appname</code>
        <img src="https://cloud.majic.rs/index.php/s/Q4XsntFZSgnW5m8/download" alt="Change stack!" />
        The other scripts should <strong>NOT</strong> be edited except you want to customize something
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Change Loading Icon or something else! Do whatever you want as long as it is efficient and it works!</p>
